# 🚀 Express Basics with Advanced Logging

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of building a Node.js server using [Express](https://expressjs.com/), enhanced with advanced logging capabilities using [Morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) and [Winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston). All logs are saved to a file named `app.log` for easy monitoring and debugging.

## ✨ Features

- Basic Express server setup
- HTTP request logging with Morgan
- Advanced, persistent logging with Winston
- All logs stored in `app.log`
